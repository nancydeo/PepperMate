# PepperMate
"PepperMate" is a web project I developed using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The idea behind this platform was to create a simple, intuitive, and visually engaging food app that allows users to explore and interact with recipes, ingredients, and cooking tips, helping them enhance their culinaryÂ skills.
